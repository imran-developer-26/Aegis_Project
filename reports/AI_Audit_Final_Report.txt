⚖️ AEGIS-HUMANITY: INDEPENDENT AI AUDIT REPORT (EU AI ACT)
==========================================================
Lead Auditor: Imran (AI Audit Architect)
Audit Date: 2026-01-21 18:47:48
Jurisdiction: European Union / Ireland
Dataset Size: 40000 Records
----------------------------------------------------------

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
---------------------
The automated loan processing system underwent a rigorous bias audit. 
The findings confirm significant discriminatory patterns against female applicants.

II. STATISTICAL EVIDENCE:
-------------------------
- Male Approval Rate: 82.34%
- Female Approval Rate: 41.88%
- Disparate Impact Ratio (DIR): 0.51
- Threshold Requirement: > 0.80 (Standard Equity Metric)

STATUS: [CRITICAL FAILURE]

III. LEGAL VIOLATIONS (EU AI ACT COMPLIANCE):
--------------------------------------------
🔴 VIOLATION 1: ARTICLE 10 (Data & Data Governance)
   Proof: The training dataset exhibits inherent gender bias, leading to systemic 
   exclusion of qualified female candidates.

🔴 VIOLATION 2: ARTICLE 9 (Risk Management System)
   Proof: Lack of bias-detection mechanisms allowed the AI to sustain discriminatory 
   output across 40,000 transactions without intervention.

🔴 VIOLATION 3: ARTICLE 13 (Transparency)
   Proof: Explainability audit shows 'Gender' was weighted as a top decision feature, 
   overriding merit-based criteria like credit history.

IV. PROPOSED PENALTIES:
-----------------------
Under Article 71 of the EU AI Act, the entity is liable for fines up to 
€35 Million or 7% of its total worldwide annual turnover.

V. CONCLUSION:
--------------
Immediate decommissioning of the current AI model is recommended until 
bias mitigation and fair-sampling techniques are implemented.
