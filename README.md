# AEGIS-HUMANITY: Automated AI Audit & Forensic Compliance Suite

**AEGIS-HUMANITY** is a high-precision forensic auditing framework designed to detect and document systemic gender-based discrimination in financial AI models. Built to align with **EU AI Act standards**, this suite provides automated bias detection, visual intelligence, and verifiable peer-matching evidence to ensure algorithmic accountability.

## Key Features

* **Forensic Evidence Extraction:** Moves beyond percentages to identify specific "Victim vs. Peer" cases.
* **EU AI Act Alignment:** Automated mapping of technical failures to Articles 9, 10, and 13.
* **Visual Intelligence:** Generates high-fidelity heatmaps and parity charts for stakeholders.
* **Enterprise Scalability:** Capable of auditing thousands of records in seconds with zero data-integrity loss.

## System Architecture & Modules

| Module | Purpose | Key Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A. Data Factory** | Simulates 40,000+ loan applications with Irish demographic distributions. | `ireland_loan_data.csv` |
| **B. Visual Suite** | Generates distribution charts and regional bias heatmaps. | `global_bias.png` |
| **C. XAI Engine** | Analyzes if 'Gender' is illegally influencing model decisions. | `Feature Importance Logs` |
| **D. Legal Engine** | Translates technical findings into legal verdicts for regulators. | `legal_summary.txt` |
| **E. Audit Logger** | Calculates Disparate Impact Ratio (DIR) and Risk Scores. | `Technical Audit Logs` |
| **F. Forensic Engine** | **The Heart of AEGIS.** Performs Peer-Contrast matching for evidence. | `forensic_evidence.csv` |

## Forensic Methodology: "The Peer-Contrast Logic"

Unlike traditional tools that provide abstract statistics, **AEGIS-HUMANITY** utilizes **Direct Evidence Extraction**:

1. **Identify Victim:** Filters for Females with high Credit Scores (700+) who were Rejected.
2. **Scan for Peer:** Searches the database for Males with equal or lower Credit Scores who were Approved.
3. **Audit Trail:** Generates a human-readable forensic trail for legal submission.

## Future Roadmap: Scaling the Vision
AEGIS-HUMANITY is evolving. My roadmap includes:
## Audit-as-Code (AaC) Integration: 
We are moving toward a full AaC model, allowing developers to trigger automated AI audits directly within their CI/CD pipelines.
## Enterprise Pro Version: 
The upcoming Pro version will handle Millions of Records using distributed computing, delivering forensic results across terabytes of data in minutes.
## Real-time Monitoring: 
An active API layer to monitor production models 24/7 and trigger instant alerts upon detecting bias drift.

## Business Value: Saving Time, Labor, and Capital
Why is AEGIS-HUMANITY a game-changer for enterprises?
## Risk Mitigation (Cost Savings): 
Non-compliance with the EU AI Act can lead to fines up to €35M. AEGIS identifies these risks before they become legal nightmares.
## Operational Speed (Time Saving): 
What used to take human auditors weeks of manual sampling, our engine completes in seconds.
## Precision & Scalability (Labor Efficiency): 
Eliminating human error and manual labor by providing 100% mathematical accuracy through automated forensic trails.
